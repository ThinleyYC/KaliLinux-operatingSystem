# KaliLinux-operatingSystem

This project aimed to provide a comparative analysis of the performance between Windows 11 and Kali Linux 2024.1 based on CPU utilization, memory utilization, disk I/O performance, and network throughput. 

1. CPU utilization for both operating systems was measured with Geekbench 6 and PerfMon providing insights into single-core and multi-core performance, as well as real-time CPU activity.
2. Memory utilization was assessed using PerfMon on Windows and Htop on Kali Linux, offering detailed statistics and real-time data on memory and swap usage.
3. Disk I/O performance was evaluated using CrystalDiskMark on Windows and Hdparm on Kali Linux.
4. Network throughput was measured using Iperf3 on both operating systems, providing detailed reports on data transfer rates and network stability.


These tools allowed for a comprehensive analysis of both operating systems, highlighting their strengths and areas for improvement. 

The results from these evaluations provide valuable insights into how each system manages resources and handles various tasks, guiding potential optimizations and hardware enhancements for improved performance.
